# OSSB - Current Limitations and Status

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Proof-of-Concept Status**

**OSSB is currently a proof-of-concept implementation and is NOT production-ready.**

The Docker image `bibin9992009/ossb-builder:latest` demonstrates the architecture and CLI interface but has significant functional limitations.

---

## 🔍 **What Works ✅**

### CLI Interface
- ✅ Complete command-line interface with Cobra
- ✅ Multi-architecture platform parsing (`--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64`)
- ✅ Dockerfile parsing and dependency graph generation
- ✅ Build configuration and validation
- ✅ Progress reporting and error handling
- ✅ Cache management interface

### Architecture
- ✅ Pluggable frontend system (Dockerfile parser)
- ✅ Pluggable executor system (local, container, rootless)
- ✅ Pluggable exporter system (image, tar, local, multiarch)
- ✅ Content-addressable caching framework
- ✅ Dependency graph solver with topological sorting

### Container Image
- ✅ Alpine-based rootless container (150MB)
- ✅ Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, QEMU installed
- ✅ User namespace configuration (uid 9999)
- ✅ Multi-arch emulation setup
- ✅ Proper entrypoint and health checks

---

## ❌ **What Doesn't Work (Critical Limitations)**

### 1. **Image Registry Operations**
- ❌ **Cannot pull base images** (FROM alpine:latest fails)
- ❌ **Cannot push built images** to registries
- ❌ **No registry authentication** handling
- ❌ **No manifest list creation** for multi-arch

**Impact**: Any Dockerfile with `FROM <image>` will fail during build execution.

### 2. **Container Build Execution**
- ❌ **LocalExecutor**: Creates directories but doesn't extract base images
- ❌ **ContainerExecutor**: May fail due to Docker-in-Docker limitations
- ❌ **RootlessExecutor**: Incomplete rootless Podman integration

**Impact**: `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD` commands don't execute properly.

### 3. **Filesystem Layer Management**
- ❌ **No layer extraction** from base images
- ❌ **No layer creation** from RUN commands  
- ❌ **No filesystem overlay** management
- ❌ **No file permission** preservation

**Impact**: Built containers have empty or broken filesystems.

### 4. **OCI Compliance**
- ❌ **Image manifest generation** incomplete
- ❌ **Multi-arch manifest lists** not created
- ❌ **Layer blob handling** missing
- ❌ **Registry V2 API** not implemented

**Impact**: Generated images aren't OCI-compliant.

---

## 🔧 **Technical Root Causes**

### Incomplete Executor Implementations

**Local Executor (`executors/local.go:62`)**:
```go
func (e *LocalExecutor) executeSource(operation *types.Operation, workDir string, result *types.OperationResult) (*types.OperationResult, error) {
    // ... setup code ...
    
    // 🚨 CRITICAL: Always returns success without pulling image
    result.Success = true
    result.Outputs = operation.Outputs
    return result, nil  // Should pull and extract base image here
}
```

**Missing Registry Client**:
- No Docker registry authentication
- No image pulling via registry API
- No blob downloading and extraction

**Incomplete Container Runtime**:
- Rootless Podman setup works but integration is incomplete
- No proper container execution environment
- Missing filesystem layer management

---

## 📋 **Detailed Error Analysis**

When running:
```bash
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 \
  -v "/workspace:/workspace" \
  bibin9992009/ossb-builder:latest build /workspace \
  -f Dockerfile -t test:latest --platform linux/amd64
```

**What happens**:
1. ✅ Dockerfile parsed successfully (3 operations detected)
2. ✅ Dependency graph built correctly
3. ❌ **executeSource() fails** - can't extract `alpine:latest`
4. ❌ **executeExec() fails** - no base filesystem to run commands on
5. ❌ **Export fails** - no valid container to export

**Error message**: `build failed for platforms: linux/amd64`

## 🎯 **Current Use Cases**

### What OSSB Can Be Used For:

1. **📚 Educational Purposes**
   - Study modern container builder architecture
   - Understand Dockerfile parsing and dependency graphs
   - Learn about rootless container concepts

2. **🔬 Development Reference**
   - CLI interface design with Cobra
   - Pluggable architecture patterns
   - Content-addressable caching implementation
   - Multi-architecture build planning

3. **🏗️ Architecture Demonstration**
   - Alternative to BuildKit's client-server model
   - Monolithic container builder approach
   - Rootless multi-architecture capabilities

### What OSSB Cannot Be Used For:

- ❌ **Production container builds**
- ❌ **CI/CD pipeline integration**
- ❌ **Kaniko replacement** (yet)
- ❌ **Docker/Podman alternative**

## 💡 **For Developers**

If you're interested in contributing or understanding the codebase:

### Key Files to Examine:
- `cmd/main.go` - CLI interface (✅ working)
- `frontends/dockerfile/dockerfile.go` - Dockerfile parser (✅ working)  
- `engine/builder.go` - Build orchestration (✅ working)
- `executors/local.go` - Local execution (❌ incomplete)
- `exporters/image.go` - Image export (❌ incomplete)

### Quick Test:
```bash
# Clone and examine the code
git clone https://github.com/bibin-skaria/ossb.git
cd ossb

# Build locally  
go build -o bin/ossb ./cmd

# Test CLI (works)
./bin/ossb build --help

# Test build (fails)
./bin/ossb build . -t test:latest
```

## 🎉 **Acknowledgments**

Despite the limitations, OSSB represents a solid foundation for a modern container builder:

- **Modern Go Architecture**: Clean, extensible design
- **Rootless-First**: Security-focused approach
- **Multi-Architecture**: Built for modern container workflows  
- **Pluggable Design**: Easy to extend and modify

**This is valuable work** - it just needs completion of the core execution engines.
