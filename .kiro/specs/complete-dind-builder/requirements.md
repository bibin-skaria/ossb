# Requirements Document

## Introduction

OSSB (Open Source Slim Builder) needs to be completed as a full-featured Docker-in-Docker (DinD) container builder that can run in Kubernetes pods, similar to Kaniko or BuildKit. The current implementation is only ~35% complete and lacks critical functionality for building and pushing container images. This spec focuses on completing OSSB to support multi-architecture builds, multi-stage Dockerfiles, and seamless Kubernetes integration without requiring privileged containers or Docker daemon access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to run OSSB in Kubernetes pods to build container images, so that I can implement CI/CD pipelines without requiring privileged containers or Docker daemon access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OSSB runs in a Kubernetes pod THEN it SHALL build container images without requiring privileged mode
2. WHEN OSSB runs in a Kubernetes pod THEN it SHALL not require access to the Docker daemon
3. WHEN OSSB completes a build in Kubernetes THEN it SHALL push the resulting image to the specified registry
4. WHEN OSSB encounters errors in Kubernetes THEN it SHALL provide clear logs accessible via kubectl logs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer building multi-architecture applications, I want OSSB to build images for multiple CPU architectures, so that my applications can run on both ARM and AMD64 platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building with --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 THEN OSSB SHALL create separate images for each architecture
2. WHEN building multi-arch images THEN OSSB SHALL create a manifest list that references all architecture variants
3. WHEN pushing multi-arch images THEN OSSB SHALL push both individual architecture images and the manifest list
4. WHEN building for an unsupported architecture THEN OSSB SHALL provide a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using complex Dockerfiles, I want OSSB to support multi-stage builds, so that I can create optimized production images with separate build and runtime stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Dockerfile contains multiple FROM statements THEN OSSB SHALL execute each stage in the correct order
2. WHEN a stage uses COPY --from=builder THEN OSSB SHALL copy files from the specified build stage
3. WHEN a multi-stage build completes THEN OSSB SHALL only export the final stage unless otherwise specified
4. WHEN intermediate stages are referenced THEN OSSB SHALL cache them for potential reuse

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with base images, I want OSSB to pull images from container registries, so that I can build containers starting with standard base images like alpine or node.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Dockerfile contains FROM alpine:latest THEN OSSB SHALL download the alpine image from the registry
2. WHEN pulling from private registries THEN OSSB SHALL support authentication via credentials
3. WHEN an image is pulled THEN OSSB SHALL cache it using content-addressable storage
4. WHEN the same image is needed again THEN OSSB SHALL use the cached version

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer building containers, I want OSSB to execute RUN commands properly, so that I can install packages and configure the container environment during build.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Dockerfile contains RUN commands THEN OSSB SHALL execute them in the correct container environment
2. WHEN RUN commands modify the filesystem THEN OSSB SHALL capture the changes as new layers
3. WHEN RUN commands fail THEN OSSB SHALL terminate the build with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN using multi-arch builds THEN RUN commands SHALL execute using the correct architecture emulation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer managing container layers, I want OSSB to create and manage filesystem layers properly, so that the resulting images are OCI-compliant and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Dockerfile instructions modify the filesystem THEN OSSB SHALL create new layers containing only the changes
2. WHEN layers are created THEN OSSB SHALL use content-addressable storage with SHA256 hashes
3. WHEN building images THEN OSSB SHALL generate OCI-compliant image manifests and configurations
4. WHEN layers are identical THEN OSSB SHALL reuse existing layers to optimize storage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer deploying applications, I want OSSB to push built images to container registries, so that the images can be deployed to production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the --push flag THEN OSSB SHALL push the built image to the specified registry
2. WHEN pushing to private registries THEN OSSB SHALL authenticate using provided credentials
3. WHEN pushing multi-arch images THEN OSSB SHALL push all architecture variants and the manifest list
4. WHEN push operations fail THEN OSSB SHALL provide clear error messages with retry guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform engineer configuring CI/CD, I want OSSB to integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes job workflows, so that I can automate container builds in my deployment pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OSSB runs as a Kubernetes Job THEN it SHALL complete successfully and exit with appropriate status codes
2. WHEN OSSB needs build context THEN it SHALL support mounting source code via ConfigMaps or Volumes
3. WHEN OSSB needs registry credentials THEN it SHALL support Kubernetes Secrets for authentication
4. WHEN builds complete THEN OSSB SHALL provide structured logs that can be parsed by monitoring systems

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want OSSB to run in rootless mode, so that I can build containers without compromising host security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rootless mode is enabled THEN OSSB SHALL build images without requiring root privileges
2. WHEN running rootless THEN OSSB SHALL use user namespaces for container isolation
3. WHEN rootless builds complete THEN the resulting images SHALL be functionally identical to privileged builds
4. WHEN rootless mode encounters permission issues THEN OSSB SHALL provide clear guidance on resolution

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer optimizing build performance, I want OSSB to provide efficient caching and build optimization, so that my builds complete quickly and use resources efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building similar images THEN OSSB SHALL reuse cached layers to reduce build time
2. WHEN using --no-cache THEN OSSB SHALL rebuild all layers from scratch
3. WHEN cache storage grows large THEN OSSB SHALL provide cache pruning capabilities
4. WHEN builds are in progress THEN OSSB SHALL display progress information and estimated completion times
