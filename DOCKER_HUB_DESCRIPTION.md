‚ö†Ô∏è PROOF-OF-CONCEPT: OSSB rootless multi-arch container builder. CLI works, core execution incomplete. Educational/demo use only.
```

## Full Description

```markdown
# ‚ö†Ô∏è OSSB - Open Source Slim Builder (PROOF-OF-CONCEPT)

**IMPORTANT: This is a proof-of-concept implementation. Not production-ready.**

## üéØ Purpose
OSSB demonstrates a modern alternative to Kaniko with enhanced multi-architecture support and rootless operation. While the CLI and architecture are complete, core build execution is incomplete.

## ‚úÖ What Works
- **Complete CLI Interface**: Full command-line compatibility with multi-arch flags
- **Dockerfile Parsing**: Successfully parses Dockerfiles and builds dependency graphs
- **Rootless Container**: Runs as non-root user (uid 9999) with proper namespaces
- **Multi-Arch Setup**: Includes Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, QEMU emulation
- **Architecture Demo**: Shows how a monolithic container builder could work

## ‚ùå Current Limitations
- **Cannot pull base images** (`FROM alpine:latest` fails)
- **Cannot execute RUN commands** (no filesystem layers)
- **Cannot push to registries** (no registry client)
- **Core executors incomplete** (~35% implementation)

## üéì Use Cases
- **Educational**: Learn container builder architecture
- **Development Reference**: Study modern Go CLI design  
- **Architecture Demo**: See rootless multi-arch concepts
- **NOT for production builds**

## üöÄ Quick Test
```bash
# Test CLI (works)
docker run --rm bibin9992009/ossb-builder:latest --help

# Test build (shows limitations)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  bibin9992009/ossb-builder:latest build /workspace \
  -t test:latest --platform linux/amd64
```

## üìö Documentation
- **Full Limitations**: See LIMITATIONS.md in repository
- **Source Code**: https://github.com/bibin-skaria/ossb
- **Architecture**: Modern pluggable design with Cobra CLI

## ‚öñÔ∏è Status
- CLI Interface: ‚úÖ 95% Complete
- Dockerfile Parser: ‚úÖ 90% Complete  
- Build Executors: ‚ùå 20% Complete
- Registry Client: ‚ùå 0% Complete
- **Overall: ~35% Complete**

## üîÆ Future
This represents solid groundwork for a production container builder. The architecture and CLI are excellent - it needs completion of the core execution engines.

**Use for learning and development reference, not production builds.**
